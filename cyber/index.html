      <p>
        The modern Internet has revolutionized the way we live. A significant
        number of services that we use, from social media to stores and
        restaurants to the power grids and sanitation plants are all connected
        to the Internet. In essence, the Internet is one big network where all
        these services can be accessed from anywhere in the world. This ability
        to be connected is very convenient, but large-scale attacks on these
        services can be devastating.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        World governments have realized that because daily life now relies on
        functioning services that are connected to the Internet, the services of enemy
        states can be attacked and brought down, especially during wars.
      </p>

      <h2>What is cyberwar?</h2>
      <p>
        <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/cyberwar" target="_blank">Encyclopedia Britannica</a>
        defines cyberwar as attacks "against government
        or military networks in order to disrupt, destroy, or deny their use."
        There are other terms, such as cyberterrorism, cyberespionage, or
        cybercrime, which may be confused with cyberwar, but because of the legal
        and political implications of war, many adversarial actions in cyberspace,
        like a phishing campaign against a corporation or a denial-of-service (DoS)
        attack against a website, might not be considered as cyberwar.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        The difficulty in distinction between cyberwar, cyberterrorism,
        cyberespionage, and cybercrime is not surprising given the low
        cost of entry into these fields. Anyone who is willing to learn the tools and has some creativity
        could pull off a widespread cyberattack. An attack aimed at a hospital network,
        for example, could accidentally spread to school or government networks.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        In the end, for practical purposes, it does not matter what category a
        cyberattack is classified as since bringing down the computers of a
        hospital is still going to affect the hospital's operations whether the
        attack was done by a military group as part of a cyberwar or by criminals
        wanting to make money.

        In this exercise, we will take a look at what a major war in the future
        may look like. Not only will there be conflict in the land, air, and sea
        (and maybe even space) domains, but there will be attacks in the
        cyberdomain as well.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        Attacks may not be limited to government or military networks; any service
        or place that is connected to the Internet could be attacked as well.

        <p>
          Welcome to the City of Bowton, a beautiful metropolis with a
          population of 700,000 people! Bowton has a diverse range of
          wonderful restaurants, shops, and museums, but like other cities,
          Bowton relies on electricity, water, gas, and telecommunications to
          function. Across the world, Bowton is known for its highly-rated
          schools and hospitals.
          <br><br>
          Below are eight targets that are critical to keep Bowton functional.
          Click on the icons to prepare a cyberattack for each target, and once
          an attack has been prepared for all targets, click on each of the
          targets again to attack.

        <h3>Prepare to attack bank and government websites</h3>
        <p>
          The citizens of Bowton rely on government and bank websites to
          access government services and to complete financial transactions.
          During this war, citizens have also received important and accurate
          information about the war from government websites.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Your Goal:</b> Deny citizens access to Bowton government and bank websites
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Vector of Attack:</b> Distributed denial of service (DDoS) - an attack
          where multiple computers bombard a server with so many requests for its
          website such that the server cannot process all requests. As a result,
          legitimate users may not be able to access the affected website.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Preparation of attack:</b> Create a botnet, which is a network of computers
          that can be controlled remotely, by tricking people into downloading
          a script that bombards the targeted websites with requests.

        <h3>Prepare to attack Bowton businesses</h3>
        <p>
          Bowton is the location of the headquarters of some very large businesses
          that citizens use daily. Wouldn't it be nice to discover some of their
          secrets and steal sensitive customer data?
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Your Goal:</b> Install backdoors into the systems of these businesses
          so that you can snoop around their servers.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Vector of Attack:</b> Remote code execution (attack that allows bad actors to run their
          code on your servers) using the Log4j zero-day vulnerability (a serious and widespread vulnerability
          that allows for RCE)
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Preparation of attack:</b> The Log4j vulnerability works by typing a specific input
          into a vulnerable application, which sends the input to a server. Upon receiving the
          input, the server downloads and executes code from a malicious server specified in the
          input.
          <br><br>
          To prepare, you write a script that enables a backdoor in the servers of these companies.
          This script will be downloaded and executed when the Log4j attack is launched.
        </p>

        <h3>Prepare to attack oil pipeline</h3>
        <p>
          Bowton relies on pipelines to bring in oil and gas for fuel to heat buildings and for
          vehicles like cars, buses, and planes. Because it is winter in Bowton now, disrupting the
          flow of oil and gas will have a significant impact on the city.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Your Goal:</b> Get into the pipeline's systems and disrupt the flow of oil and gas.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Vector of Attack:</b> Leaked password
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Preparation of attack:</b> Sometimes it is not necessary to have to hack through a
          backdoor; going through the front door works as well - that is, if you have the key. You
          keep up with cybersecurity news and are aware that this oil pipeline company has recently
          suffered a data breach. Maybe the passwords to its systems are lying somewhere in the
          dark web... To prepare, you search the dark web in an attempt to find these passwords.
        </p>
        <br><br><br>

        <h3>Prepare to attack water treatment plant</h3>
        <p>
          Treating wastewater is an important part of a functioning city. Without it, health and
          environmental concerns could arise from water pollution. As part of the treatment process,
          sodium hydroxide is added to the water. In small amounts, sodium hydroxide is fine, but
          large amounts can be dangerous.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Your Goal:</b> Get into the human machine interface (HMI) that controls the amount of
          sodium hydroxide in the water and raise its levels to a dangerous amount.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Vector of Attack:</b> Guess password to the HMI
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Preparation of attack:</b> In your research, you have scanned the network of the
          water treatment plant and have found a login page to their systems that have been left
          exposed to the public Internet so that employees can remotely check on the plant. To
          prepare, you research possible credentials that they might use.

        <h3>Prepare to attack electric grid</h3>
        <p>
          The electric grid provides the most essential aspect of a functioning society:
          electricity. Without it, very few things can run. Cutting power to the city should bring
          it to a standstill.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Your Goal:</b> Break into the systems of the electric grid, switch off the substations,
          and delete as many things as possible to slow their recovery.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Vector of Attack:</b> Spear phishing emails
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Preparation of attack:</b> In spear phishing, targeted emails are sent to certain
          people in order to try to trick them into providing sensitive information or opening a
          malicious file. To prepare, you draft an email, which you send to electric company
          employees, pretending to be their CEO. In the email, you write that
          an urgent matter needs to be addressed, followed by a link to get more details on the
          matter. The link leads to a fake electric company login page where employees are tricked
          into entering their real credentials, which allows them to download a PDF that contains
          the details of the matter. Little do the employees know that the PDF, when opened,
          installs backdoors to the electric company's systems and that you have their passwords.

        <h3>Prepare to attack hospitals and schools</h3>
        <p>
          Hospitals and public schools are highly vulnerable targets to cyberattacks because of
          their importance but relatively lax standards in cybersecurity. Hospitals and schools are
          digitalizing patient and student records, which means a compromise of these could severely
          damage the operations of these institutions.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Your Goal:</b> Prevent hospitals and schools from accessing their records by encrypting
          their files and holding the decryption key for ransom.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Vector of Attack:</b> Spear phishing emails and ransomware
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Preparation of attack:</b> A spear phishing email is an email targeted at key
          individuals which tricks them into clicking a link that downloads malware. To prepare for
          this attack, write some code that encrypts all the files on a system. To make your attack
          more nefarious, write some additional code that spreads your ransomware to other
          computers over the network so that every computer at your targets become infected.

        <h3>Prepare to attack ISP</h3>
        <p>
          The Internet is an essential part of life now; our digital lives rival that of our
          physical ones. Behind the scenes, Internet service providers (ISP) keep the backbones of
          the Internet running. Without them, the Internet simply would not exist. If you could
          comromise the core routers of the Internet, you could take out Internet service for a
          large number of commercial and residential users.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Your Goal:</b> Gain access to the core routers of the ISP in Bowton and shut them down.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Vector of Attack:</b> Zero-day vulnerability (a previously unknown vulnerability) that
          provides a backdoor into a machine
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Preparation of attack:</b> Third-party software can contain bugs that allow
          unauthorized users to gain access into systems. Because it is easier to use existing
          software than write new versions, companies will use existing third-party software as a part of their operations. If
          a vulnerability exists in the third-party software, then all the companies that use that
          software are vulnerable as well.
          <br><br>
          To prepare, do a scan of the ISP's network to determine possible software that the ISP
          uses. After finding some software that they use, do an online search for vulnerabilities
          in the software and read up on how to exploit the vulnerabilities.

        <h3>Prepare to attack nuclear plant</h3>
        <p>
          A significant amount of Bowton's electricity is generated from the nearby nuclear plant.
          The nuclear plant utilizes centrifuges as part of the process to generate electricity. If
          you can gain access to the controls for the centrifuges, you could spin the centrifuges so
          fast that they break themselves apart.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Your Goal:</b> Gain access to the centrifuges and spin them as fast as possible.
        </p>

          replicating itself)
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Preparation of attack:</b> Like many networks, a lot of machines are connected to the
          nuclear plant's network. More important machines are hidden behind more layers of
          security. The centrifuges are an integral part of the plant, so its computers are
          air gapped, or not connected to the Internet. The only way to transfer information
          between the centrifuge computers and the outside world is through a USB stick.
          <br><br>
          To prepare for attack, write the worm that will spread through the plant's network, onto
          the USB devices, and into the centrifuge. To get your worm inside the plant, you will
          send a phishing email as your attack.

          businesses, so that you can execute your code on their servers.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Your Goal:</b> Install a backdoor into the systems of these businesses
          so that you can snoop around their servers.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Vector of Attack:</b> Remote code execution (allowing attackers to run their code on

          <b>Attack:</b> The Log4j vulnerability is widespread, but not every system is prone to
          attack, either because the system does not use the Log4j software, or it uses a patched
          version of the Log4j software. To attack, you try injecting your code into every text box

            <p>Your important files are encrypted.</p>
            <p>
              Many of your documents, photos, videos, databases and other files are no longer
              accessible because they have been encrypted. Maybe you are busy looking for a way to
              recover your files, but do not waste your time. Nobody can recover your files without
              our decryption service.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p><b>Can I Recover My Files?</b></p>
            <p>
              Sure. We guarantee that you can recover all your files safely and easily. But you have
              not so enough time. You can decrypt some of your files for free. Try now by clicking
              Decrypt. But if you want to decrypt all your files, you need to pay. You only have 3
              days to submit the payment. After that the price will be doubled. Also, if you don’t pay
              in 7 days, you won’t be able to recover your files forever. We will have free events for
              users who are so poor that they couldn’t pay in 6 months.

      <h2>Damage to Bowton</h2>
      <p>
        Taking down all eight targets, you have inflicted a huge amount of damage on Bowton.
        With online services down, citizens find it difficult to obtain goods and services from
        businesses and institutions.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        From the point of view of businesses and institutions, they
        are also finding it difficult to service customers, and even worse, because their networks
        has been breached, they must deal with potential leaks of sensitive company and customer
        data, like trade secrets and social security numbers.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        The critical infrastructure of Bowton did not take their hits well either. Because you
        released high levels of sodium hydroxide into their water, citizens have been avoiding
        use of tap water and are buying more expensive bottled water for several days.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        Oil and gas have become more expensive as well, given the shortage that has surfaced from the
        shutdown of the pipeline. This attack has stung the city since it is below freezing in Bowton
        right now.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        Taking down the electric grid virtually brought the city to a standstill since
        like any modern city, the people are highly dependent on electricity. This attack did not
        have as worse of an impact though because power was shut down for only a few hours, and
        critical infrastructure and large buildings have their own backup generators.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        Finally,
        amongst all the chaos, a portion of Bowton citizens could not conveniently get information
        about what attacks were happening or what they should do because they did not have Internet.

      <h2>Reality of Cyberwar</h2>
      <p>
        The goal of this exercise was to illustrate what a full-scale cyberwar may look like. Of
        course, it is difficult to predict what an actual one would look like. An adversary may
        attempt all of the attacks listed above, but some luck is required for success since the
        attacks depend on the presence of the right holes in victim networks. In reality, all the
        attacks require much more preparation than written above.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        Cyberwars could be fought concurrently with a traditional war. In this case, a traditional
        military would invade a country as cyberwarriors attack that country's cyber infrastructure.
        The conventional army could also participate in the cyberwar as well by destroying the
        infrastructure needed to keep cyber systems running, such as routers or computers.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        With conventional militaries, it is possible to judge their strengths and weaknesses based
        on the previous wars they have participated in and on weapons that are showcased in military
        parades. A nation's cyber capabilities are harder to judge because of the secrecy that is
        needed to keep such cyberweapons effective. Best practices can be followed, which will
        increase the difficulty of a successful attack, but that cannot guarantee complete security.
