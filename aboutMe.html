				Hello there! My name is Derek Ng, and I am an undergraduate student at
				<a href="https://northeastern.edu/" target="_blank">Northeastern University</a> majoring in cybersecurity
				and minoring in mathematics. You can find more information about my academic life on the
				<a href="academics.html">Academics page</a>.
				<br><br>
				Outside of academics, I love playing piano. I have been playing piano since August 2007. I created a
				<a href="http://djn.x10host.com/piano/" target="_blank">website</a> for my piano teacher that has some recordings of
				me playing. This <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCCVlwrpT_wmZpcXU7gyNg4A/videos" target="_blank">YouTube channel</a>
				also has those recordings. Some of my favorite pieces to play include Beethoven's Third Movement of the Moonlight
				Sonata and Grieg's Wedding Day at Troldhaugen.
				<br><br>
				I also love swimming and running. I have been swimming since as long as I can remember. I have swam on multiple
				teams including my high school's varisity team. My favorite events are the 100 breaststroke and the 500 freestyle.
				I began running by joining my school's cross country team during sophomore year in high school. Before that, I had
				never ran over a mile, but after some practice, I was able to run the full 5K. Being at Northeastern, it is very fun
				to run to different places around Boston and the surrounding cities.
				<br><br>
				Other random things I like include: the colors blue and orange, looking at maps, looking at buildings (especially
				skyscrapers), and dim sum.
				<br><br>
				The best way to contact me about anything is to send an email! <a href="#footer">Scroll down</a> to the footer.
